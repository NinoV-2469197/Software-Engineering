## Challenges in Requirements Engineering

- Requirements engineering is a difficult process with numerous challenges that cannot be fully resolved by technology .
- Key issues affecting requirements engineering include changing requirements, differing stakeholder perspectives, lack of standardization, and the influence of personal views and organizational politics .

## Changing Requirements

- Requirements must adapt to reflect changes in the real world, which is dynamic and often unpredictable .
- Types of changes that can affect requirements include technological advancements, organizational restructuring, market shifts, economic fluctuations, and legal modifications affecting critical systems .

## Stakeholder Perspectives

- Diverse stakeholders have varying perspectives on a system, leading to conflicting requirements .
- Key stakeholder perspectives include users, management, customers, technical engineers, regulators, and societal viewpoints, particularly for critical systems .
- Engaging stakeholders is challenging, as they are often busy with their primary responsibilities, making it difficult to gather detailed requirements .

## Lack of Standardization

- The requirements specification process lacks objective metrics for assessing the quality of requirements .
- There is no standardization in requirements engineering across different industries, making it difficult to derive effective processes .
- The required level of detail for requirements can vary significantly depending on the type of system being developed .

## Influence of Politics and Personal Goals

- Individual politics and personal goals significantly impact decision-making in requirements engineering .
- Stakeholders may prioritize their interests over the collective needs of the organization, complicating the requirements process .
- Existing systems may lead to resistance against new proposals, as individuals might prefer the comfort and familiarity of current solutions .

## Conclusion

- Requirements engineering faces inherent difficulties that arise from varying changes in technology and business, diverse stakeholder perspectives, lack of standardization, and subjective organizational politics .
