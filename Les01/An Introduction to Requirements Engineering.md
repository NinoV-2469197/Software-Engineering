## Importance of System Requirements
- Requirements serve as a bridge between real-world problems and software systems, translating issues into actionable tasks for software engineers.
- They are identified early in the software process through analysis of user problems and define what the system should do.
- Requirements include various types, such as functional, nonfunctional, and domain requirements, each addressing different aspects of system functionality and constraints.

## Types of Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**: Specify what the system should do, e.g., a medical system that alerts doctors about patient allergies.
- **Nonfunctional Requirements**: Describe the system's qualities, such as an availability requirement that limits downtime for critical operations.
- **Domain Requirements**: Arise from the specific application domain, e.g., privacy requirements in medical systems regulated by data protection laws.

## Requirements Engineering Process
- Requirements engineering encompasses activities to elicit, collect, understand, analyze, and validate requirements.
- It is systematic and repeatable, aiming to produce a complete and consistent set of requirements for implementation.

## Consequences of Poor Requirements
- Incorrect requirements can lead to budget overruns and delayed software delivery, necessitating additional unplanned work.
- They may cause customer dissatisfaction, resulting in underutilized systems or abandonment due to unreliability.
- Inappropriate requirements often mean additional post-delivery costs to make the system fit for its intended environment.

## Challenges in Requirements Engineering
- Users often struggle to express what they want, making it difficult to capture accurate requirements.
- The rapid change in business environments complicates the stability of requirements, leading to obsolete specifications.
- Conflicting views among stakeholders mean that requirements often end up as compromises, leading to ambiguity.
- Organizational politics can influence requirements based on subjective considerations rather than objective needs.

## Conclusion
- Requirements should clearly express what the system should do and describe its desirable qualities.
- Difficulties in requirements are major contributors to software engineering problems and delays, emphasizing the need for proper requirements engineering.
