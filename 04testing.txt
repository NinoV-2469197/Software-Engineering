1. Unit Testing:
Purpose: Tests individual units or components of code (like functions, methods, or classes) in isolation.
Focus: Smallest pieces of functionality, ensuring each part works as expected independently.
Tools: JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), PyTest (Python), Jest (JavaScript).
Example: Testing if a function that adds two numbers returns the correct sum.
2. Integration Testing:
Purpose: Ensures that different components or systems work together as expected.
Focus: The interaction between units or modules (e.g., how services, APIs, or databases interact).
Tools: JUnit with Spring (Java), Postman (for API testing), PyTest with fixtures.
Example: Testing if an API endpoint correctly retrieves data from a database.
3. Functional Testing:
Purpose: Verifies that the software works as per functional requirements.
Focus: Ensures the system behaves as expected, based on the provided input/output.
Tools: Selenium, Cucumber, Postman.
Example: Checking if a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.
4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing:
Purpose: Tests the entire application flow, from the start to the end, simulating real user behavior.
Focus: The full system, ensuring different modules work together and the entire user experience is functional.
Tools: Cypress, Selenium, TestCafe.
Example: Testing an online shopping process from adding items to the cart to checkout and payment.
5. Acceptance Testing:
Purpose: Ensures that the system meets business requirements and is ready for use.
Focus: Whether the system fulfills the customer's needs, often done by or in collaboration with the customer.
Tools: FitNesse, Cucumber.
Example: A client verifying that a new feature works according to their specifications before accepting the release.
6. Regression Testing:
Purpose: Ensures that new changes or updates haven't broken existing functionality.
Focus: Re-running previous tests to confirm everything still works after modifications.
Tools: Selenium, TestNG, JUnit.
Example: Running all user login-related tests after modifying the authentication system to confirm nothing was broken.
7. Performance Testing:
Purpose: Measures the speed, responsiveness, and stability of the system under various conditions.
Focus: Performance metrics like load times, scalability, and stress handling.
Tools: JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling.
Example: Testing how many concurrent users a website can handle before slowing down.
8. Load Testing:
Purpose: Assesses the system's behavior under a specific expected load.
Focus: Ensuring the system can handle expected traffic or data volume.
Tools: JMeter, Locust, BlazeMeter.
Example: Testing if a server can handle 10,000 users simultaneously accessing a web application.
9. Stress Testing:
Purpose: Tests the system beyond its normal operational capacity to see how it handles extreme conditions.
Focus: Finding the breaking point of the system, how it degrades under stress.
Tools: JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling.
Example: Overloading a system with requests until it crashes to identify the upper limit of performance.
10. Usability Testing:
Purpose: Evaluates how easy and user-friendly the application is.
Focus: User experience, ensuring the interface and workflow make sense to real users.
Tools: Crazy Egg, Usabilla, Optimal Workshop.
Example: Having users perform tasks (like signing up for an account) and tracking their ease of use and satisfaction.
11. Security Testing:
Purpose: Identifies vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by attackers.
Focus: Ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus.
Example: Penetration testing to check if unauthorized access to sensitive data is possible.
12. Smoke Testing:
Purpose: Quick testing of the system to check if the critical functionality works after a build or deployment.
Focus: Verifying basic functions of the system to determine if it's stable enough for further testing.
Tools: Automated test scripts (Selenium, JUnit).
Example: Running a few key tests (like logging in) to ensure the application is functional after a deployment.
13. Sanity Testing:
Purpose: Verifies that specific functionality or bugs have been fixed without doing exhaustive testing.
Focus: Narrow checks after changes to confirm the targeted area works as expected.
Tools: Same tools as for smoke testing.
Example: After fixing a bug in the shopping cart, testing just that feature to confirm itâ€™s working correctly.
14. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Purpose: Done by the end users or clients to verify that the product works according to their requirements.
Focus: Real-world scenarios from the perspective of the end user.
Tools: Could be manual or automated, depending on the client.
Example: Having the client test a new feature in their environment before going live.
15. Exploratory Testing:
Purpose: Involves testers manually exploring the application without predefined test cases to identify unexpected issues.
Focus: Ad hoc, creative testing to find unusual bugs or edge cases.
Tools: Manual or tools to assist exploratory testing like TestRail or PractiTest.
Example: A tester navigates through the system without a specific test script to see if they can find any unpredictable behavior.
